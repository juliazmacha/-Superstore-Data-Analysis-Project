# Superstore Data Analysis Project

## Overview

This project analyzes the [Kaggle Superstore Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vivek468/superstore-dataset-final?select=Sample+-+Superstore.csv) to gain insights into business performance. The data was cleaned and prepared before using SQL to extract meaningful information that supports decision-making for the business.
